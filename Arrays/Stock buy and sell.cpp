Medium Accuracy: 39.53% Submissions: 33416 Points: 4
The cost of stock on each day is given in an array A[] of size N. Find all the days on which you buy and sell the stock so that in between those days your profit is maximum.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 7
A[] = {100,180,260,310,40,535,695}
Output:
(0 3) (4 6)
Explanation:
We can buy stock on day 0,
and sell it on 3rd day, which will 
give us maximum profit. Now, we buy 
stock on day 4 and sell it on day 6.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 5
A[] = {4,2,2,2,4}
Output:
(3 4)
Explanation:
We can buy stock on day 3,
and sell it on 4th day, which will 
give us maximum profit.

Your Task:
The task is to complete the function stockBuySell() which takes an array A[] and N as input parameters and finds the days of buying and selling stock. The function must return a 2D list of integers containing all the buy-sell pairs. If there is No Profit, return an empty list.


Expected Time Complexity : O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)


Constraints:
2 <= N <= 103
0 <= Ai <= 104
